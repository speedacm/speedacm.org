<b>Student Linux User Group (SLUG)</b>: Linux runs the supercomputers and servers of our society. Student Linux User Group (SLUG) is where we discuss Linux and the Free and Open Source Software used with it.
<br>
<b>Cyber Defense</b>: We go over topics such as hardening Linux and Windows, best computer practices, and Over the Wire exercises. One of our main focuses is the CCDC team competition. 
<br>
<b>Game Development</b>: In our meetings we help each other code, design, and create to learn the game development process and hopefully have a fun project to show for it. 
<br>
<b>CCDC</b>: Our club helps prepare you for the two competitions throughout the year, invitational and state qualifier. In those competitions, we become a blue team to defend a network of systems against a group of professional red teamers. Teams that make it to regionals are able to travel to other schools in different states for the regional competition.
