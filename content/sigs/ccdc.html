The CCDC clib is centered on preparing students for participation in the national Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

CCDC is an experiential cybersecurity competition that simulates real-world enterprise environments. Members will work collaboratively to secure, monitor, and maintain a network of systems while actively defending against live "red team" attacks that attempt to compromise services and data.
