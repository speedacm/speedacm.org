The CCDC club is centered on preparing students for participation in the national Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

CCDC is an experiential cybersecurity competition that simulates real-world enterprise environments. Members will work collaboratively to secure, monitor, and maintain a network of systems while actively defending against live "red team" attacks that attempt to compromise services and data. 
In addition to technical defense operations, participants are required to complete business-oriented tasks such as making and submitting incident reports, maintaining service availability, and responding to tasks that ask you to install software, implement firewall rules, and more. 

Through hands-on practice, team-based problem solving, and exposure to realistic adversarial scenarios, the club provides members with skillsets in system administration, network defense, incident response, and professional communication that closely mirrors expections in modern cybersecurity careers. 
After one year of being in this club, you should be able to use cybersecurity terminology at the beginners level. After 2+ years, you should be able to hold a semi-knowledgable conversation with a cybersecurity specialist.

For more information about joining CCDC, please join the discord server and grab the #CCDC role. 
Our meetings are on Sundays from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM or later in Duthie Center 119.
