				<p class="lead">The Speed ACM is the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Louisville. We are dedicated to anything and everything computing and to providing our members the resources and support that they need to succeed!</p>

				<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<p>The Speed ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter at the University of Louisville. We are dedicated to providing resources for students interested in all things computing! We foster community by hosting fun events such as alumni workshops, documentary screenings, gaming nights, community dinners, professional seminars, and volunteer opportunities. We also have Student Interest Groups (SIGs) dedicated to Game Development, Hacking, Linux, and Cybersecurity. Members often spend time with each other in our lab in the basement of the J.B. Speed School of Engineering building in room 002. Here, students can find a snack shop, a lending library of technology, textbooks, and a study space.</p>
			
				<h2>Student Interest Groups</h2>
				<p>Expand your skills, learn, meet new people, and have fun!</p>
